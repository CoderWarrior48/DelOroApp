      Del Oro serves a semi-rural community trying to maintain slow growth while being surrounded by communities of high growth. There has been a phasing out of the agricultural way of life and an increase of homes on acreage and small housing tracts within our attendance boundaries. The area is becoming a bedroom community for the greater Sacramento area. There continues to be slow growth of businesses within the community, but the existing businesses are generally very supportive of Del Oro.

      Del Oro draws its students from two elementary districts which are composed of seven K-8 elementary schools. In addition, approximately 350 of our students are on inter-district agreements from surrounding districts, and 106 are intra-district/open enrollment from one of our district high schools. The school is located a few miles from Sierra College, which allows many students to attend concurrently.

      In 2011, Del Oro was named a California Distinguished School by the Department of Education. In 2012, Del Oro received the maximum 6-year accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).
