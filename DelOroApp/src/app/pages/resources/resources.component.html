      Eagle Time is a flexible time built into the regular school day for students to access extra support for the their classes, meet with a teacher, meet with a club, make up a quiz, or stop to catch up on homework.

      3rd Block: Unless it's PLC Monday or Advisory Tuesday, Eagle Time happens most regular school days during 3rd block.
      
      Flexisched: Early in the week, students use a program called Flexisched (pronounced "Flexy-skedge") to sign up for which intervention offerings they'll attend that week. Teachers also regularly sign students up for Eagle Time when they know students need additional support and accountability.
