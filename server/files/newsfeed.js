    content: `Prestige Portraits is our official senior portrait photographer for the Del Oro High School Yearbook.  So, if you want a photo in the yearbook for your senior year, you must (at the very least) take a yearbook only photo with Prestige. They are going to be on our campus  July 24 through the 28th and the attire will be a traditional cap and gown photo (items will be provided for the photo). Prestige will email you with your appointment time two weeks before the appointment dates. If you need to reschedule, you will be able to online through the email they send you or you can call them at 1-877--825-7922. You can also contact Prestige directly at byarea@lifetouch.com or call 1-877-825-7922 for any questions. Again, these portraits are the only way to get a senior portrait in the yearbook. 
   *Please note: You do not need to pay for these portraits. You can let them know at your appointment that you want the yearbook only photo shoot. However, if you want to be able to select the picture you want in the yearbook, you will need to pay a $25 studio fee and they will edit 3-4 photos and email them to you to select which one you want for the yearbook.  Otherwise, for the free package, they will select the photo for you.
    
   Deadline for seniors to photograph: October 6, 2023
   Deadline for seniors to choose their yearbook pose: October 20, 2023  
   
   
   Yearbook attire: Cap and gown with cap on: (these items will be provided by prestige portraits)
